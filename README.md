# Adventure Map Mobile (Ionic 1.x)
AdventureMap Mobile application - Ionic v1 ðŸ˜ž


### Running tests

#### Features
This project uses Protractor and CucumberJS for acceptance tests
Feature files are placed in `tests/features` folder. 
Step definitions are placed in `tests/features/step_definitions`

##### Dependencies
Install `protractor` and update the webdriver

```shell
$ npm install -g protractor
$ webdriver-manager update
```

This line may be necessary:
```
$ node_modules/protractor/bin/webdriver-manager update
```

##### Running the tests
In order to run features, an instance of the application must be running:

```shell
$ ionic serve
```
(See below for more options)

Then open another tab on your terminal and to run the test you must run the following command:
```
$ npm run cucumber
```
In order to run a specific scenario you can run `protractor` with a `--specs` flag: 
```
protractor tests/protractor.conf.js --specs tests/features/feature_file_.feature 
```

### Running the App
You can choose to run the app on your phone or in an emulator.

#### iOs Simulator
Run the following commands
```
$ gulp sass # May not be necessary - This will compile the stylesheets
$ ionic platform remove ios (optional)
$ ionic platform add ios
$ ionic emulate ios
```

#### Browser
You can run the app in your browser by starting the Ionic server with:
```
$ gulp watch sass # Run this in a separate terminal
$ ionic serve
```

You can access the application by navigalign to:
```
http://localhost:8100/
```

If you prefer to view a simulator of iOS and Android side by side, you can choose to do that by navigating to:
```
http://localhost:8100/ionic-lab
```

You can also choose to run the Ionic server in the background by using `screen` Execute the following command:

```
$ screen -d -m -L ionic serve --address localhost -p 8100 --nolivereload --nogulp --nobrowser &
```

Remember to terminate the process when you no longer need to run the process:

Find out the PID (numeric value) for the process
```
ps aux | grep ionic
```
That will return a list of processes that runs Ionic

Terminate the process with the `kill` command
```
$ kill 11111 #whatever number your process has (PID)
```

If you revisit `http://localhost:8100/` you should no longer be able to access the application.
